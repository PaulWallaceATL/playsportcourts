## üîê Security Notes

### Current Implementation (Development)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Mock Authentication**
- Uses localStorage for session management
- Passwords are NOT encrypted (plain text)
- No password reset functionality
- No email verification

‚ö†Ô∏è **Not Production Ready**
- Replace with NextAuth.js or Clerk before production
- Implement proper password hashing (bcrypt)
- Add email verification
- Add two-factor authentication

### Production Requirements

‚úÖ **Required for Production:**
1. Real authentication provider (NextAuth.js/Clerk)
2. Database for user storage
3. Encrypted passwords (bcrypt/argon2)
4. Email verification
5. Password reset flow
6. Session management (JWT/cookies)
7. Rate limiting
8. CSRF protection

---

## üìù Notes

### Password Guidelines

Test passwords are intentionally simple for development:
- Original accounts: `password123`
- New accounts: `admin2024!` or `dealer2024!`

**Production passwords should:**
- Be at least 12 characters
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- Not be dictionary words
- Be unique per account

### Account Types

**Admin Accounts:**
- Access to admin dashboard only
- Cannot place orders
- Can view all dealer orders
- Can manage all products and users

**Dealer Accounts:**
- Access to dealer portal only
- Can browse catalog and place orders
- Can view own order history
- Cannot access admin features

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Can't Login

**Issue**: Invalid credentials error

**Solutions:**
1. Double-check email and password (case-sensitive)
2. Clear browser cache and cookies
3. Check localStorage is enabled
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode

### Account Locked Out

**Issue**: Can't access after multiple failed attempts

**Solution**: 
Currently no lockout mechanism. If you're having issues:
1. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
2. Refresh page
3. Try again

### Lost Access to Admin

**Issue**: Accidentally changed admin role to dealer

**Solution**:
Edit `src/lib/mock-auth.ts` and ensure admin accounts are in SEED_USERS with `role: "admin"`, then refresh.

### Order Not Showing

**Issue**: Placed order doesn't appear in admin dashboard

**Solution**:
Orders are currently stored in localStorage. Ensure you're logged in and check browser console for errors.
